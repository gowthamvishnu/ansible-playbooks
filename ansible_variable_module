 - hosts: all
   become: yes
   vars:
    x: 45
    my_name: "vishnu"
   vars_prompt:
    name: y
    prompt: enter the value for y
   tasks:
    - debug:
       msg:
        - "The x value is: {{x}}"
        - "The my_name value is: {{my_name}}"
        - "The value of y is: {{y}}"
Note:you can define variable in yaml or in host file as well.
*If you want to override the variable the command line has the highest priority.
*In the about example x value is 45 but when you are executing playbook,
if you pass another value to the variable through command line it will override with the command line value by following command

cmd:   ansible-playbook playbookname -e "x=33"
                         (or)
       ansible-playbook playbookname --extra-vars "x=33"
