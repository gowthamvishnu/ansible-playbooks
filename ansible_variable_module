#Inputs and Outputs of Ansible playbook (or) how to read and print a variable value?
---
 - hosts: all
   become: yes
   vars:
    x: 45
    my_name: "vishnu"
   tasks:
    - debug:
       msg:
        - "The x value is: {{x}}"
        - "The my_nmae value is: {{my_name}}"
        
        
 # If we want to read the variable values we use variable_promt
 # Variable_promt contains 2sections
 1.name (varible name)
 2.promt(to display the messge in commandline)
  #Usage

 - hosts: all
   become: yes
   vars:
    x: 45
    my_name: "vishnu"
   vars_prompt:
    name: y
    prompt: enter the value for y
   tasks:
    - debug:
       msg:
        - "The x value is: {{x}}"
        - "The my_name value is: {{my_name}}"
        - "The value of y is: {{y}}"
Note:you can define variable in yaml or in host file as well.
*If you want to override the variable the command line has the highest priority.
*In the about example x value is 45 but when you are executing playbook,
if you pass another value to the variable through command line it will override with the command line value by following command

cmd:   ansible-playbook playbookname -e "x=33"
                         (or)
       ansible-playbook playbookname --extra-vars "x=33" 
   
3)we have another option called private while usin variables.we can give this option under prompt
 private yes(means while you entering a value through command line it won't display what you are entering.it will keep it private)
 private no (means while you entering a value through command line it will display what you are entering)
 
 usage:       
 vars_prompt:
    name: y
    prompt: enter the value for y
    private: yes (or) no
